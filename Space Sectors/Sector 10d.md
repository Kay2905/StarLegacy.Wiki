## Overview
Sector 10d has no planets but has a massive asteroid belt and wrecks of derelict ships. 10d asteroids are rich in
oriomium, a valuable ore that can be sold for high prices at the space station within
the sector. New players that would like to earn money easily are recommended to mine
here. The high gravitational forces present within the sector will tear apart large
ships, so only ships that are 7990 blocks or less may enter. Drilling equipment will
also destabilize ships and destroy them if they have 4 or more drills.

## Systems

### Blackular
A small neutron star with a high gravitational force. Its asteroid belt is massive and
contains valuable oriomium.
