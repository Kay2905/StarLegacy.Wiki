## Quick Notes

This planet's mysterious beauty and bountiful mineral resources are concealed by a vast, icy surface. Strays and skeletons patrol the many islands and continents, and the freezing cold will eventually kill anyone that's not wearing a space suit or a power helmet with an environmental module. Due to its proximity to Jadiid, it is a great place for new players to live if they would like to take more risks in return for greater rewards.
