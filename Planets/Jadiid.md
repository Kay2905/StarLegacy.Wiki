## Quick Notes

All new players spawn on Jadiid. Flat plains entrenched between tall mountains makes this planet the ideal location to start off when first entering Star Legacy. Zombies and spiders prey on the weak, so make sure to prepare before setting out. Nations are not allowed to claim territories on Jadiid and PVP is disabled, allowing Jadiid to be the safest location in Andromeda.
